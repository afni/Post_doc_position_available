We, the [AFNI team](https://afni.nimh.nih.gov), are looking for a technically-minded and motivated person to work on scientific/statistical computing applied to brain imaging. 

#### What you will be doing

Example projects we want to address include (but are not limited to):

+ Extending AFNI's visualization interfaces to web-capable graphics technologies.
+ Better methods for detection of image changes between groups of subjects (including integrating single subject and group analyses into one processing step).
+ Work with local experts in applying machine learning to neuroimaging to develop better methods for denoising FMRI datasets.
+ Develop methods for testing a single subject’s FMRI data vs. a “fiducial” group, to find outlier results.

#### Desired background

+ Scientific computing, particularly the use of C/C++ and Python. 
+ Experience in graphics development (or a desire to learn it). Examples of relevant software would include Vulcan, WebGL, or Unity.
+ Experience in computational linear algebra.
+ An interest in "problem solving" both independently and collaboratively.

This position is a 1 year appointment, normally renewable 2 times (for a total duration of 3 years).
We are looking for someone to start as soon as practicable, but the timing is flexible.
More information on NIMH fellowship programs can be found at the [NIMH website](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/labs-at-nimh/scientific-director/office-of-fellowship-and-training/fellowships-and-training-programs/index.shtml).


#### Who we are
Our Core is mainly comprised of people with backgrounds in the fields of math, physics, engineering, statistics, computer science, and neuroscience.
We maintain and continue to develop an open source set of tools for the neuroimaging community. We also hold workshops in fMRI analysis methods.
In all cases, work is done in collaboration with NIH researchers to ensure that the resulting methods and software are useful and usable.  

We are located at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, MD, USA, in the ever-interesting Washington, DC, metropolitan area.


#### Interested?
Please send: any queries and/or a cover letter of interest including descriptions of your programming experience (projects worked on, stating your own role and the language used) and a copy of your CV to:  i.want.to.join.afni@gmail.com.
