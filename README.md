## Postdoc Position in AFNI Group
[AFNI](https://afni.nimh.nih.gov), Scientific and Statistical Computing Core, NIMH (Bethesda, MD, USA)

We are looking for motivated person with a strong interest in programming to work on scientific/statistical computing applied to brain imaging. Example projects we want to address include (but are hardly limited to):
Better methods for detection of image changes between groups of subjects (including integrating single subject and group analyses into one processing step).
Work with the new Machine Learning Team to develop better methods for denoising FMRI datasets.
Develop methods for testing a single subject’s FMRI data vs. a “fiducial” group, to find outlier results.
Our Core is mainly comprised of people with some combination of math, physics, engineering, statistical and computational background.  We maintain and continue to develop an open source set of tools for the neuroimaging community, as well as teaching in analysis methods.  In all cases, work is done in collaboration with NIH researchers to ensure that the resulting methods and software are useful and usable.  

Desired background:
Strong skills in scientific computing, particularly the use of C and/or C++, with Python and OpenGL experience also being useful.
Mathematical and statistical background commensurate with the ability to understand technical papers on data analysis methods, to critique them, and to develop new ideas for data analysis. Experience in computational linear algebra desired.
An interest in "problem solving" and the ability to work independently on problems, as well as to collaborate with the rest of the group.
Preferably, a basic knowledge of common functional MRI data analysis methods, but programming and scientific computational experience is more important.

This position is a 1 year appointment, normally renewable 2 times (for a total duration of 3 years). We are looking for someone to start as soon as practicable, but the timing is flexible. More information on NIMH fellowship programs can be found at

We are located at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, MD, USA, in the ever-interesting Washington, DC, metropolitan area.

Please send: any queries and/or a cover letter of interest including descriptions of your programming experience (projects worked on, stating your own role and the language used) and a copy of your CV to:  i.want.to.join.afni@gmail.com.
